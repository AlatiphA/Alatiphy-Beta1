## Features

### Playback
- Play, pause, skip to next/previous track
- Seek bar with click and drag support (mouse and touch)
- Real-time playback time display (`current / total`)
- Next track preloading for smooth transitions
- Restores last played track and playback position on relaunch

### Repeat & Shuffle
- **Repeat Off** — plays through the playlist once and stops
- **Repeat One** — loops the current track indefinitely
- **Repeat All** — loops the entire playlist
- **Shuffle** — randomly selects the next track, never repeating the current one

### Volume & Mute
- Volume slider with persistent state across sessions
- Mute/unmute toggle with icon feedback
- Volume and mute state saved to `localStorage`

### Song List & Playlists
- Filter tabs: **All Songs**, **Recently Added**, **Rap**, **R&B**, **Remix**, **Afrobeats**
- **Favorites** tab — heart any song to save it; persists across sessions
- Song duration displayed per track (scanned progressively on first load, then cached)
- Active track highlighted and auto-scrolled into view

### Search
- Live search filters the current playlist as you type
- Current playing track always stays visible even when it doesn't match the search
- Clear button to reset search instantly

### Player UI
- Spinning vinyl cover art with glow animation while loading, slower spin while playing
- Scrolling marquee title for long song names
- **Mini player mode** — collapse to a slim bar at the bottom; swipe up to expand
- Collapse/expand button always accessible

### Swipe Gestures (Mobile)
- Swipe **left/right** on the player to skip to next/previous track
- Swipe **down** to collapse into mini player
- Swipe **up** to expand the full player
- Velocity-based detection — fast flick or slow drag both work
- Ignores swipes on interactive controls (seek bar, volume, buttons)

### Downloads & Offline
- Download any track to the device via the `⋮` player menu
- Downloads stored in **IndexedDB** — survive app restarts and offline use

- Downloaded songs marked with a `⬇` indicator in the list
- **Downloads view** in the sidebar shows all locally saved tracks

### Share
- Share button in the `⋮` player menu
- Uses the native Web Share API on mobile; falls back to copying the link on desktop

- Once dismissed or installed, the prompt never shows again (`localStorage` flag)
- Service Worker for offline caching and background updates
- Web App Manifest with icons, theme colour, and standalone display mode

### Sidebar Navigation
